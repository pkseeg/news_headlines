# Goals
The intended outcome of this project is to create a word embeddings from news article headlines from a diverse set of news sites. News article headings often have different language structure than body text, so I think these embeddings could be useful in academic research - particularly in the [research](https://github.com/spenc34/fake-news-detector) that I've done on fake news detection.

# Data
The headlines used in creating these embeddings came from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/news-aggregator-dataset) publicly available dataset on kaggle. I chose this dataset because it features news headlines from a diverse set of publishers, over 10,000 different publishers.
